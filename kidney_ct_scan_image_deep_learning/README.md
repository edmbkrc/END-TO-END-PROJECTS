Kidney CT Scan Classification

ðŸ“– Project Overview
- This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify kidney CT scan images into distinct categories (Normal,  Tumor).
- The goal is to assist in the automated and rapid diagnosis of common kidney conditions from medical imaging data.
- The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and includes all steps from data preprocessing to deployment-ready model export with MLflow and DVC.
